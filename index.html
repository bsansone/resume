            Primarily doing front end development and a small amount of backend
            work at a very early growing fashion startup. I helped provide
            design direction for all web related content that was produced
            through the engineering team and was the go-to person for any HTML
            and CSS advice. Starting at the company as a Front End Developer
            intern and then being promoted to a Software Developer during my
            first year.

              Maintained and updated an internal processing tool which employees
              used to document and authenticate product that came through our
              systems. Initially developed by the head dev which I then took
              over and eventually became the sole maintainer.

              Helped rebuild eCommerce site from Shopify platform into custom
              solution using React, Redux, Restify, AWS Solutions (DynamoDB,
              Elasticsearch, Cognito), and Stripe Payments. Developed a
              dynamically generated homepage that could be controlled via
              Contentful CMS. Additionally began development of a React Native
              port using common files to share Redux actions and reducers across

              Migrated a Salesforce user portal to standalone React/Redux
              application that allowed the user to edit account information,
              view and interact with all the product they have consigned with
              the company. Grabbed data from the users account in Salesforce and
